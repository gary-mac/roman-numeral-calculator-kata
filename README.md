Kata Requirements:  
I == 1 V == 5 X == 10 L == 50 C == 100 D == 500 M == 1000 

The symbols I, X, C, and M can be repeated at most 3 times in a row V, L, and D can never be repeated 

As arabic numbers can be split into their constituent parts (1066 becomes 1 0 6 6), so too can Roman numerals. 

1066 becomes MLXVI, or M (1000) LX (60) and VI (6) The symbols (I, X, and C) can only be subtracted 
from the 2 next higher values. For example,     
IV and IX -- (usage of I in subtraction rule)     
XL and XC -- (usage of X in subtraction rule)     
CD and CM -- (usage of C in subtraction rule) 

The symbols (V, L, and D) can never be subtracted. 
Only one subtraction can be made per numeral (XC is allowed, XXC is not).
